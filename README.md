# Rust - Fingerprint Groups

## Programmers: Eason Chen (me), Amir Rahmat (partner)

## Acknowledgement: Talked about assignment specifications for the project, Amir told me we needed to read from standard input, from from a file.

## Implementation: I believe that the loop and use of splitn were correct implementations, I had trouble with the printing of elements, specifically how to categorize something as a group. But I was able to implement this with the use of .enumerate and another index parameter.

## Problems that can be solved with using FGroups: Data processing for organization, and grouping data. Specifically I can see this sort of program being useful in a database, and allowing one to query data based on an identifier or fingerprint.

## Time spent: This assignment took me about 2 hours to implement, and I spent about 4-5 hours this week reading the Rust book to get familiarized with the language.
